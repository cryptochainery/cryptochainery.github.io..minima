Proof-of-work is an important concept and underlying principle for blockchains and any cryptocurrency like bitcoin, ethereum, etc.

### Formal definition of Proof-of-work
Here is the definition from Wikipedia: A proof-of-work (PoW) system is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer.

This can be a very long and confusing definition for a lay-man. In simple terms, proof-of-work implies that a computer/system has to do a huge amount of work to satisfy a goal or achieve something. Because the amount of work is a lot and quite difficult, it deters a lot of hackers from even trying to attempt the task at hand. The concept was invented by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor as presented in a 1993 journal article.

Another characteristic of proof-of-work is that the answer/result should be easily verifiable. So, it should be extremely hard to arrive at the answer, but it should be very easy to verify the answer.

**Caution**: while it might be necessary to make the proof-of-work problem hard to solve in order to deter hackers, it should not be a deterrent to genuine users of the system as well.

### Types of Proof-of-work systems
There are two well known proof-of-work systems:

- **Challenge-response protocols**: here there is a direct link between the client and server. The client asks for a service and is given a problem to solve. After he solves the problem, he send the answer to the server who verifies it and responds with the requested service.
- **Solution verification**: there is no direct communication between the sender and the receiver. The sender knows the problem ahead of time and solves it and sends it to the receiver. After the receiver gets the answer he verifies it and takes the next steps.

Remember: In cryptocurrencies like bitcoin which run on blockchain, the **solution verification** approach is used.

### Recap of Proof-of-work systems
The important points that you need to remember about proof-of-work are:
- proof-of-work requires a person to do a lot of work before he can arrive at an answer.
- the problem should be very hard to solve, but, easy to verify.
- it should not affect genuine users (in a bid to deter hackers)
blockchain (bitcoin and cryptocurrencies) use the “solution verification” approach and proof-of-work forms a fundamental aspect of blockchains.
