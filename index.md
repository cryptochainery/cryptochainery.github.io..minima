description: Simple blockchain and bitcoin technology tutorials to teach you how bitcoin, ethereum, and blockchain work and how you can use them in your business.
---

One of my main goals is to demystify blockchain, bitcoin, ethereum, and other crypto-xyz topics. I've structured the tutorials in simple byte-sized articles. You can read them in any order, but I've listed them in a sequence that makes blockchain easy to understand. 

If you find errors, or have improvements to suggest, please send me an email at cryptochainery_at_gmail.com. Thank you and good luck!
